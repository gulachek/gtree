Both:

tree {
	byte[] value;
	tree[] children;
}

How do you represent an integer?

little endian base-128
ending byte is when the high bit is not set

00 -> 0
01 -> 1

80 01 -> 128

Previous encoding:

<how big is the "node block">

	node block:
	< how many nodes? >
	foreach node in BFS order:
	<value bytes length>< num children >

	data block:
	foreach node in BFS order:
	<value bytes>

Current encoding:

	< nbytes of value > < value > <n children > < recurse >
